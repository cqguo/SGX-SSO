\begin{abstract}
Single sign-on (SSO) services are widely deployed in the Internet as the identity management and authentication infrastructure.
In an SSO system, after authenticated by the identity provider (IdP),
 a user is allowed to log into relying parties (RPs) by presenting an identity proof.
Meanwhile, SSO introduces the potential leakage of user privacy:
    (\emph{a}) the curious IdP could track a user's all visits to any RP,
     and (\emph{b}) collusive RPs could link the user's identities across different RPs, to learn the user's network activity profile.
NIST suggests that pairwise pseudonymous identifiers (PPIDs) shall be adopted to prevent collusive RPs from linking a user,
    as PPID mechanism enables a user to log in multiple RPs with different identities.
However, the widely-adopted PPID mechanism cannot protect users from the IdP's tracking, as it still exposes RP identities to the IdP.

In this paper, we propose an SSO system, named \emph{UP-SSO},
 providing the enhanced PPID mechanism to protect a user's profile of RP visits from both the curious IdP and the collusive RPs by integrating PPID and SGX.
It separates the IdP's function into two parts, the server-side function and user-side part.
The generation of PPIDs is shifted from the IdP server to the user client, so that the IdP server no longer needs to learn RP identities to issue identity proofs.
%User client also transforms RP ID into a one-time encrypted ID, used by IdP for identity token generation, instead of RP's real ID.
The integrity at the user side is verified by the IdP through the remote attestation of SGX.
%The server-side service running on the IdP server still takes the responsibility of authenticating users, storing the private key, issuing the identity token, etc.
The detailed design of UP-SSO is described, and we analyze its security and privacy protection.
We implemented the prototype system of UP-SSO, and the evaluation shows the overhead is modest.
