\section{Background}
XXX is compatible with OIDC, and achieves the privacy protection based on the SGX.
Here, we provide a brief introduction on OIDC and the SGX.
\subsection{OpenID Connect}
OIDC~\cite{OpenIDConnect} is an extension of OAuth 2.0 to support user authentication,
 and becomes one of the most prominent SSO authentication protocols.

\noindent\textbf{Implicit flow of user login.}
OIDC supports three processes for the SSO authentication session, known as {\em implicit flow}, {\em authorization code flow} and {\em hybrid flow} (i.e., a mix-up of the previous two). Here, we propose the OIDC implicit flow as the example to illustrate the protocol.

\end{figure}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:OpenID}, the implicit flow of OIDC consists of 7 steps: when a user attempts to log in to an RP (Step 1), the RP constructs a request for identity proof, which is redirected by the user to the corresponding IdP (Step 2). The request contains $ID_{RP}$, RP's endpoint and a set of requested user attributes. If the user has not been authenticated yet, the IdP performs an authentication process (Step 3). If the RP's endpoint in the request matches the one registered at the IdP, it generates an identity proof (Step 4) and sends it back to the RP (Step 5). Otherwise, IdP generates a warning to notify the user about potential identity proof leakage. The RP verifies the id token (Step 6), extracts user identifier from the id token and returns the authentication result to the user (Step 7).

\subsection{Intel SGX}
Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX) is the hardware-based security  mechanism provided by Intel since the sixth generation Intel Core microprocessors, which offers memory encryption that isolates specific application code and data in memory.
It allows user-level code to allocate private regions of memory, called enclaves, which guarantees the running code are well protected from the adversary outside the enclave.
 
\noindent\textbf{Remote Attestation.} The SGX remote attestation allows a player to verify three things: the application's identity, its intactness (that it has not been tampered with), and that it is running securely within an enclave on an Intel SGX enabled platform. Moreover, with the remote attestation, the secure key exchange between the player and remote enclave application is also available even the application runs in the malicious environment.
